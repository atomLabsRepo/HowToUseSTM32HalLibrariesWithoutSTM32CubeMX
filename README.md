# How to use STM32 Hal Libraries without STM32CubeMX

## A tutorial by Atomax Labs

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use STM32 HAL Libraries without auto-generating
code from CubeMX software.

## How will we do it?

We will directly copy the drivers from STM website and make our project.

## What project will we make??

We will use USART drivers and write a simple UART application in which it connects to Arduino
via UART and prints data in Arduino Serial Monitor
